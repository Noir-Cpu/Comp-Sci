Overview of the Snake Game Code

Purpose:
The provided Python script implements a simple console-based Snake game using the Pygame library. The game has basic functionalities such as controlling the snake's movement, eating food, and handling collisions. The code is structured into several functions to manage different aspects of the game.

Key Components:

1. **Initial Parameters and Setup:**
   - The game window has a width and height of 600 pixels, and the size of each block is set to 20 pixels.
   - Pygame's font module is initialized for displaying the score.
   - Initial score is set to 0.
   - Colors (WHITE and RED) are defined using RGB values.
   - The Pygame library is initialized, and the game window and clock are set up.

2. **Snake and Food Initialization:**
   - The snake is initially positioned at the center of the window.
   - The `generate_food()` function is defined to randomly place the food, ensuring it doesn't overlap with the snake.

3. **Drawing Objects:**
   - The `draw_objects()` function is responsible for rendering the snake, food, and the current score on the game window.

4. **Updating Snake:**
   - The `update_snake()` function manages the snake's movement, growth when it eats food, and checking for collisions.

5. **Game Over:**
   - The `game_over()` function checks if the game should end due to hitting boundaries or colliding with itself.
   - If teleporting through walls is enabled, hitting the screen's edge wraps the snake to the opposite side.

6. **Game Over Screen:**
   - The `game_over_screen()` function displays the game over message along with the final score. It allows the player to either replay or quit.

7. **Game Loop:**
   - The main `run()` function initializes game variables and enters the game loop.
   - Player input (arrow keys) controls the snake's direction.
   - The game continuously updates, checks for collisions, and redraws the screen until the player quits or the game ends.

8. **Main Execution:**
   - The script concludes with the main execution block, calling the `run()` function when executed as a standalone program.

 Usage:
- Run the script to start the Snake game.
- Control the snake's direction using the arrow keys.
- Collect food to increase the score.
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.
